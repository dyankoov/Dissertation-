Model Recreation & .npy File Generation

To fully recreate the trained model and reproduce all results, it is essential to rerun the entire pipeline from scratch. This process will regenerate all .npy files used for training, validation, and backtesting. These files are not stored in the repository because they are large-format binary files and cannot be uploaded. 

Before running the scripts, make sure the following Python libraries are installed: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, quantstats, matplotlib, seaborn.
